# OCR Classification with k nearest neighbour algorithm on some book pages

A machine learning project I did as part of my degree. K nearest neighbour classifier for OCR
with error correction.

## How to run

Training the model and evaluating it on some data is easy with the shell script I created.
```shell script
./run_evaluate.sh
```
(Note you must be using python 3.)
