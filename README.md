# OCR Classification with k nearest neighbour algorithm

A machine learning project I did as part of my degree. K nearest neighbour classifier for OCR
with error correction for pages from a book.

## How to run

Training the model and evaluating it on some data is easy. Just use the shell script I created:
```shell script
./run_evaluate.sh
```
(Note you must be using python 3.)
